In this paper, I will be talking about three specific website, Amazon, Yahoo, and Netflix. I will be describing how they use data, user interface and the logic of the website. All three websites uses data in some way to store users input whenever they use the websites. Only different is what they do with the data that they collect from its users. The user interface of the three website if fairly the same with users being able to interact with everything that they see, just in different ways. Amazon uses its collected data to advertise other items that you might be interested in. Yahoo uses data do store its article and able the users to access those data. Netflix is a streaming service so it output video data that users want use.   

Almost everyone knows about Amazon. Its a website that sells anything that you can think of. Amazon has a complex database that keeps track of all its inventory around all their warehouses. It makes sure it has what one might needs in a certain demographic areas, that way they can ship it as fast as one day shipping. It has a database that keeps track of everything that they have of a specific item. Not only that, but also its customer data.  With such a huge inventory, Amazon's customer can often feel overwhelmed with all the options that they have. That's why amazon uses Big Data gathering from customer. Everything that a customer does in their website, it keeps that data such as what you buy, what you look at, your shipping address and whether yo leave reviews or feedback and uses it to fine tune its recommendation engine. The more amazon knows about you, the better it can recommend things that you might want to buy. That's why when one searches for something on the search bar, you'll immediately start getting recommendation of item similar to what you searched. The user's interface of amazon is complex yet simple. On top of the website it has  a search bar input that one uses to fine tune anything that you might want to buy. You can use it by picking specific category or do a general overall search.  On the top right corner, you have a logo of a shopping cart as well as other bottom that will take you to you own account profile and a return/orders bottom that will take you to a link where it shows all your previous purchases. On the top left corner you have your main menu slide that gives you options of specific category that you might be interested like books, electronic and pets supplies. The rest of space that amazon uses on his website are recommendation. With the data that it collects from you, it'll make educated guess on what you might be interested on and show you product of it. In a  simple way of explaining it, once you pick an item to buy, you added to your shopping cart. Once its added, you proceed to the checkout link. In this link it'll confirm your shipping address and payment information as well as a summary of your shopping cart.  

Yahoo website uses database in a different way.  Yahoo is a simpler website that uses only database to store it's news and articles. Everything that you see in the website is store in a database. All the comments that one inputs in a story will be store in it.  One thing that they do is collect data of articles that's popular on a area and puts it on their suggestion side of the website. The way the website UI works is by having a search bar to top of the web. This search is just like the google one meaning that you can search for anything at all and it'll give you results of it. It also has topic bar where you can search for new/article by topic like finance and sport. In the middle of the website, it has latest trending news that you might be interested in. On the right side it'll give you a list of the top trending topics. In the middle right side you will also see information regarding the whether and some advertisement. On the top right corner it'll give you option to sign in to you yahoo email if you have one. The way the website works is if you click on any bottom, it'll directly send you to that new/article that you clicked on.

Another website that uses data would be Netflix.com. Netflix has a massive database that stores the videos, as well as user information that they have. This website also track users input when they use the website. With the collections of users input, it'll make a guess on what videos you might be interested base on what kind of videos you most watch like action, comedy or horrors movies. Once it has enough information, it gives you other types of videos that relates to the type of video you most watch. The way UI works is by having a simple interface. On top of the website you would have a home, tv shows, moves, latest or MyList buttons that will take you to a more define list of videos base on what you pick. On the top right corners you have a mini search bar, and a profile bottoms.  Also in the top half of the screen it will show an image of the main Netflix movie/show that it came out, with a brief summary of it and its title with a button to play that video.  If one goes lower it'll give you a picture list with its name base on what's popular on Netflix, trending now, comedies, etc. When you click a selection it'll sent that data to the servers and you will immediately start streaming that video.

All three website use data in a collective way that store users input to "better" improve users experience. Amazon and yahoo uses targeting ads to show advertisement that you might be interested in. Netflix on the other hand uses its collected data to predict what you might be interested in watching.
